 * Your products, including drones, or the sale or marketing of Your 
 * products, including drones.
 * 3. ASSUMPTION OF RISK:  You acknowledge that the operation of the 
 * software, alone or in a product, including drones, is a potentially

 * modified by You and whether or not implemented in connection with a 
 * reference design provided by any third party.
 * 4. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER:  IN ADDITION TO THE WARRANTIES DISCLAIMED IN THE

 * Terms provide a copyright-only license to the software while these 
 * Supplemental Terms and the Clear BSD License for the software are in 
 * effect, and do not provide any patent licenses.  If any patent licenses 
 * are needed in connection with Your products and/or the software, such 
 * patent licenses must be obtained separately and in writing.  
 * 6. INDEMNIFICATION:  You agree to defend, indemnify and hold the current 
 * and previous copyright holders, their affiliates, employees, directors, 
 * agents, licensors, successors and assignees (each an “Indemnified Party”) 
 * harmless from any and all claims, penalties, demands, causes of action, 
 * liabilities, lawsuits, or damages, including attorneys’ fees and costs, 
 * that result from or relate to the software or any product, including 
 * drones, made, used, sold, imported, exported, or distributed by You which 
 * uses the software or any part or derivative work thereof, even where such 
 * product uses the software without modification and even where the design 
 * of such product is identical to the design of any reference product,

 * Indemnified Party for which You are responsible under this Section, the 
 * Indemnified Party shall promptly notify You when it becomes aware of such 
 * claim or action, provided, however, that any delay in notification shall 
 * not relieve You from Your indemnification obligations under this 
 * Agreement.  The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate in 
 * the defense of such claim or action, including any related settlement 
 * negotiations.  No such claim or action may be settled or compromised 
 * without the Indemnified Party’s express written consent, which may be 
 * conditioned upon the execution of a release of all claims against the 
 * Indemnified Parties by the party bringing such claim or action. 
 * 7. INSURANCE:  If You make or distribute drones, or participate in making 
 * or distributing drones, You agree to and will maintain (throughout the 
 * time You are using any of the software in connection with such drones) 
 * insurance providing adequate coverage for potential product liability, 
 * personal injury, property damage, and privacy claims and litigation 
 * associated with such drones and/or software.
 * 8. GENERAL:  These Supplemental Terms, together with the Clear BSD 
 * License, constitute the entire agreement of You and the current and 
 * previous copyright holders with respect to the subject matter of the 
 * foregoing, and supersede all prior representations, understandings and 
 * agreements with respect thereto.  No amendment to the Clear BSD License 
 * or these Supplemental Terms shall be binding unless in writing and signed 
 * by authorized representatives of You and the current and previous 
 * copyright holders.  No waiver of any term, provision, or breach of these 
 * Supplemental Terms or the Clear BSD License will be effective unless it 
 * is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the current 
 * and previous copyright holders.  Any such waiver shall be effective only 
 * in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which it is 
 * given.  If any provision of these Supplemental Terms or the Clear BSD 
 * License is held to be invalid or unenforceable, whether in whole or in 
 * part, the remaining portions of such provision (if any) and the other 
 * provisions of these Supplemental Terms and the Clear BSD License shall 
 * remain in full force and effect, and the provision that is found to be 
 * invalid or unenforceable shall remain in effect to the maximum extent 
 * permitted by applicable law.  These Supplemental Terms and the Clear BSD 
 * License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
 * the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to the choice of laws 
 * principles thereof.  The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the 
 * International Sale of Goods shall not apply.  Any dispute, claim or 
 * controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be 
 * adjudicated only by a court of competent jurisdiction in San Diego, 
 * California, U.S.A., and You consent to the personal jurisdiction of such 
 * court for purposes of such dispute, claim or controversy.
